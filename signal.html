      <div id="about">
          <p>The Signal Protocol is a cryptographic protocol which allows users anywhere in the world to securely communicate. It is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank">end-to-end encrypted</a> communication apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and many others.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="how-it-works">
          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>Essentially, the Signal Protocol uses a combination of <strong>Public-key encryption</strong>, <strong>Diffie-Hellman</strong> key exchange, and a method of encryption called the <strong>Double Racthet Algorithm</strong> in order to make it nearly impossible for would-be attackers to snoop on private conversations.</p>
          <p>Where many encryption protocols and applications simply use one or two methods of encryption, usually based around public-keys and certificates, the Signal Protocol uses layers and layers of encryption in order to provide the highest possible level of security. Not only that, but the Signal Protocol allows for completely asyncrhonous communication; this means that two users don't need a session in order to communicate.</p>
          <p>Let's look at an example of how two users would start communicating with each other using this protocol:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Our first user, Hannah, has installed an application that uses the Signal Protocol. The first step in using this protocol is the generation of keys. Every user of this protocol will produce:
                  <ul>
                      <li>A public key, which live on a server, freely available to everyone.</li>
                      <li>A <em>signed</em> public key, which will also live on the server. This will prove to everyone else that Hannah owns this key.</li>
                      <li>A private key, which only the user knows.</li>
                      <li>A large set of one-time-use public and private keys. The public keys will live on a public server; if someone wants to communicate with Hannah, they must grab one of these one-time-use public keys. The private counterpart keys will remain on Hannah's device.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Once Hannah has all of her keys generated, another user can now start to communicate with her. Let's call him Jonas.</li>
              <li>Jonas wants to communicate with Hannah. He asks the server to give him her info, and the server sends him:
              <ul>
                  <li>Hannah's public key</li>
                  <li>Hannah's signed public key</li>
                  <li>One of Hannah's one-time-use keys</li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>Now Jonas and Hannah have everything they need! They have <strong>five</strong> total keys, including an "ephemeral" key that Jonas uses to start the dialogue, and now the two users will perform <strong>four</strong> Diffie-Hellman exchnages:
              <ul>
                  <li>Jonas' public key and Hannah's signed public key</li>
                  <li>Jonas' ephemeral key (which is only used to start the communication) and Hannah's public key</li>
                  <li>Jonas' ephemeral key and Hannah's signed public key</li>
                  <li>Jonas' ephemeral key and Hannah's one-time-use key</li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>Once all four of these Diffie-Hellman exchanges are complete, Jonas and Hannah will have a shared secret that is very tough to crack.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Now that Jonas and Hannah have this shared secret, they can send messages to one another! Despite the seemingly laborious levels of encryption and security we've already covered, the Signal Protocol goes even further by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm" target="_blank">Double Ratchet Algorithm</a>. This is interesting process essentially ensures that every single message has a new set of keys that Hannah and Jonas use to encrypt and decrypt with! If you want to know how this works, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sO2qdTci-s" target="_blank">this video from Computerphile</a>.</p>
          <p>Here's a video that explains this process in detail:</p>

          <h2>Public-Private Encryption Keys</h2>
          <p>The public-private key system is a very widespread protocol across the internet. All modern encryption systems use some form or another. Let's explore the concept with a small example:</p>
          <p>Let's say Elliot wants to have a secure conversation with his friend, Angela. Elliot decides to make two cryptographic keys. These keys can both encrypt messages and decrypt them. However, they are perfect mirrors: what one key encrypts, only the second key can decrypt. Likewise, what the second key encrypts can only be decrypted by the first key.</p>
          <p>So Elliot has made these two mirrored keys. Since he wants to be able to send secure messages back and forth with Angela, all he has to do is give her one of these keys! Now Elliot can encrypt messages for Angela, which she can then decrypt.</p>

      <div id="diffie">
          <h2>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h2>
          <p>The Diffie-Hellman method of forming shared secrets has been around since the 1970s. It's also very common, yet it's very clever.</p>
          <p>Again, let's illustrate with an example! Perhaps Katherine needs to send a clandestine message to Leo. They both have secret keys that can encrypt <strong>and</strong> decrypt, and no one else is allowed to see their keys. Instead of trading copies of their keys with each other, which would mean that their secret key is no longer their secret, they devise a plan to make a <strong>shared secret</strong> that only they can use to encrypt and decrypt their messages.</p>
          <p>They do this with the help of a <em>public</em> key. Katherine takes the public key, combines it with a copy of her secret key, and sends this 2-key combo over to Leo. Leo does the same, sending a 2-key combo to Katherine. Then, Leo <em>and</em> Katherine take their secret key and add it to the 2-key combo, thus making an entirely new 3-key combo!</p>
          <p>The beauty of this is that now they both have the exact same 3-key combo, which they made independently! Neither Katherine nor Leo ever saw the other's secret key, yet they now share a 3-key secret, which they can use to encrypt and decrypt messages to one another.</p>
          <p>This is the essence of the Diffie-Hellman exchange system. Perhaps this video from Computerphile can explain a little better:</p>
